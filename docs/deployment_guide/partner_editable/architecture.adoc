.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway to allow access to the internet.*
+
When deploying the optional BankDemo demonstration applications, TN3270
communications from the internet will also flow through the internet
gateway.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Optional Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) instances in the public
subnets for administrative access.*
* In the private subnets:
** Enterprise Server instances that can be accessed via a TN3270 terminal emulator or HTTP.
** A Network Load Balancer to automatically distribute requests for the BankDemo demonstration applications to the deployed Enterprise Server instances.
+
This is how the Enterprise Server instances are configured for use with the BankDemo demonstration applications. If you modify the AWS
CloudFormation template (to tailor it for use with other applications), you must allow the required protocols through the load balancer and
specify the required number of instances.
+
NOTE: The Partner Solution can deploy a maximum of two Enterprise Server instances for demonstration purposes. If you are an SI who wants to
launch additional Enterprise Server instances as part of a migration project, you must modify the templates supplied with this Partner Solution.
+
** An optional Fileshare instance that is preconfigured to be accessible from the Enterprise Server instances (via Fileshare) and accessible
directly via the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol share for batch processing.
** An optional Microsoft SQL Server database using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for SQL Server with support for failover
and automated backups. The database is preconfigured to work as a relational data store for Enterprise Server.
** An optional Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster that is preconfigured to work as an SOR for Enterprise Server.
** AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD).
