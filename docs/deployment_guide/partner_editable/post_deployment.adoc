== Post Deployment steps
To test the successful deployment of Enterprise Server on the AWS Cloud, you run a demonstration application called BankDemo: an application that runs an imaginary banking company, which provides simple banking functionality such as displaying accounts and transactions, transferring funds between accounts, and changing users' contact details. +
Refer to the _Test the Deployment_ section of _Micro Focus Quick Start Deployment Guide_ for detailed instructions on running this application.
